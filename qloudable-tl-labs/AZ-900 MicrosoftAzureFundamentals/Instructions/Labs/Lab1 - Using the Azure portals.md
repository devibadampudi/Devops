## Overview

The aim of this lab is to become familiarize with the interface of the Azure portal, focusing on their customizability and the Azure support for retrieving billing and resource usage data.

### Scenario and Objective

XYZ Training Labs Corporation is an IT services company, based in the United States, with satellite offices and employees around the world. XYZ Training Labs Corporation does not use cloud-based services for any of its technology needs. Its employees are well-versed in Microsoft technologies and tools, and the IT department is fully proficient in configuring and maintaining Active Directory, and in using SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio for administrative tasks.

However, XYZ Training Labs Corporation wants to investigate how Azure could help reduce IT deployment, management, and development costs. XYZ Training Labs Corportation managers believe this might drastically reduce the total cost of ownership of their applications and provide simplified world-wide access to these applications. XYZ Training Labs Corporation intends to evaluate which of their IT services can run efficiently in Azure.

To prepare for future deployments to Azure, you plan to become familiar with the interface of the Azure portals, focusing on their customizability and the support for retrieving billing and resource usage data.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

*	Customize the Azure portal interface.

*	Display billing and usage data for your Azure subscription


## Pre-Requisites

*	Azure portal subscription with the required access.

4.	Note the current usage and quotas for different types of resources.

**Note:** *Because this is the beginning of the course, it is likely that the subscription has not incurred any charges and that does not include any resources. In this case, you will see a message that usage or billing data is not available. You should consider revisiting this interface on the second day of the course. Additionally, keep in mind that this interface will allow you to track cost of resources going forward, so you should review it frequently.*

### Task 2: View billing data in the Azure Account Center

1. From the Azure portal, navigate to the Cost Management + Billing â€“ Overview

2.	If you receive a prompt, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.
